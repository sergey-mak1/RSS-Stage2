Hello! My name is Sergey. I’m 33 years old. I’m from Belarus, Minsk. I’m divorced, but now I have a new wife who is a teacher.
I have 2 kids. They’re 6 and 5. I graduated from Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in security engineering. 
I currently work in the communications industry.My experience in this field is more 10 years.
Why I started learning Frontend Development? 
I have long been interested in the IT sector, I believe that this is a promising direction in our time, with a fair wage.
 Why did I choose Frontend? I like to see the result of my work in real time, since I'm a bit of a perfectionist, I like fixing bugs, finding a problem and sorting it out.
Started training with the HTML Academy marathon in November 2022 and successfully passed it.In March of this year, I completed the RSShool course (stage 0) and got into the top 200.
 What concerns my character and skills, I’m very hard-working, responsible, curious and social person with a good sense of humor.

 In my free time, I enjoy fishing and cars.

Unfortunately, I did not record a video, because I studied German at school, and my knowledge of English is at the level of "London is the capital of Great Britain",
 but in the future I plan to learn English.
